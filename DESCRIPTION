Description: Time series analysis commonly investigates how movements of
  prices and other variables can be explained by historic values. Similarly,
  multivariate time series analysis studies how different time series
  influence each other. This package implements methods for studying a
  panel of unrelated time series -- we refer to it as "grouped" time series.
  Possible applications stem from panel observations of time series (e.g. from
  different participants in experiments) or from time series with breaks (e.g.
  from missing values). The following models are adapted: (1) ARMA, (2) GARCH.
